                    In the world of AI, behavioural predictions are leading the
                    charge to better machine learning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is so much happening in the AI space. Advances in the
                    economic sectors have seen automated business practices
                    rapidly increasing economic value. While the realm of the
                    human sciences has used the power afforded by computational
                    capabilities to solve many human based dilemmas. Even the
                    art scene has adopted carefully selected ML applications to
                    usher in the technological movement.

                    As a Senior Client Engineer, you'll work alongside other
                    engineers, designers, and product managers to tackle
                    everything from huge company initiatives to modest but
                    important bug fixes, from start to finish. You'll also
                    collaborate with your product team on discovery, helping to
                    assess the direction and feasibility of product changes.
                    And, perhaps most importantly, you'll actively contribute to
                    the evolution of the culture and processes of a growing
                    engineering team.

                  <p>
                    You love building great software. Your work could be
                    supporting new feature development, migrating existing
                    features, and creating other mobile and web solutions for
                    customers. You'll have a primary focus on frontend
                    development using JavaScript. Our client's tech stack is
                    JavaScript, primarily using React. A strong understanding of
                    JS core (ES2019+) is required, with some exposure in Java as
                    back-end technology. We use modern tools, which means you'll
                    have the opportunity to work with Webpack, Redux, Apollo,
                    Styled Components, and much more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You love learning. Engineering is an ever-evolving world.
                    You enjoy playing with new tech and exploring areas that you
                    might not have experience with yet. You are self-driven,
                    self-learner willing to share knowledge and participate
                    actively in your community.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Having overlap with your team is critical when working in a
                    global remote team. Modus requires all team members to
                    overlap with EST morning hours daily. In addition, reliable
                    high speed internet is a must.
